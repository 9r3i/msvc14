# What is VC14?
- VC14 is Visual C++ 14 from Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 14 Packages (MSVCR14) 2015
- I collect these files for common problem among my friends.
- While they were asking for help, the problem is always be the same, that some dynamic library (*.dll files) is missing.
- Besides, they have installed the MSVCR 2015 and 2017 from official website.
- Usually for using PHP 7.x or Apache2 in Windows OS only.


# Installation
- The best way is install MSVCR from official website (recommended). https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145
- For any application in Windows OS that requires MSVCR 14, simply copy the 59 files in directory vc14, then paste in the directory where the binary is.
- For AI users, simply use command: ```$ ai install ext.msvc```
